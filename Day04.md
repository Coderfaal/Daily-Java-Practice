# 🔢 Day 4 - Second Largest Element in Array

## 🧠 What I did
- Wrote a Java program to find the second largest number in an array.
- Avoided sorting — implemented efficient logic using a single traversal.

## 📌 Code Location
[SecondLargestFinder.java](src/main/java/corejava/arrays/SecondLargestFinder.java)

## 🔍 Output Sample
Second largest element: 98


## 📓 Learning
- Improved my array traversal logic.
- Learned how to manage edge cases.
- Practiced conditional logic with tracking multiple variables.
